# Concat - Queue App
This web application was created to allow students to generate help tickets and for a teacher to be able to select and solve tickets based on the time they were submitted.

Students may also join existing tickets, allowing a single teacher to assist multiple students. Teachers can keep solution notes and refer back to solutions across the entire class.
